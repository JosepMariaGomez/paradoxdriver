The length of the leader may be zero for type B fields. Theleader for a type M field must be at least one byte.      If you define a memo field as M40, then the length of the leaderis 40. If the memo data is over 40 bytes long, then the entirememo is stored in the MB file and the leader contains a copy ofthe first 40 bytes. If the memo data is less than 41 bytes long,then the leader contains all of the data and nothing is stored inthe MB file.The MB file is described later in this document.
